  <meta name="description" content="I am David, and I program. I may still go to school, but that doesn't mean i can't still make a good website or two. I find that in programing i find the backend parts much easier. I don't feel i can do justice to design even if i try. I feel one of the the best things i have learned is that i don't need to do everything by myself. My skill in JavaScript really helped along in creating my first project, Orbit Newtab. I worked on it with one of close friends and feel it deserves to be somewhere in this place." />
