          I am David, and I program. I may still go to school, but that doesn't mean i can't still make a good website or two. I find that in programing i find the backend parts much easier.
          I don't feel i can do justice to design even if i try. I feel one of the the best things i have learned is that i don't need to do everything by myself. My skill in JavaScript
          really helped along in creating my first project, <a href="https://orbitelite.github.io/get/">Orbit Newtab</a>. I worked on it with one of close friends and feel it deserves to be somewhere in this place.
