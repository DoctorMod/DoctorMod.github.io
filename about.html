          I am David, and I program. I may still go to school, but that doesn't mean I can't still make a good website or two. I find that in programming i find the backend parts much easier. I don't feel I can do justice to design even if I try. I feel one of the best things I have learned is that I don't need to do everything by myself. My skill in JavaScript helped along in creating my first project,
